# Outlawed - A mod to LucasArts 1997 game "Outlaws"
## Update
This is a work in progress - For a ready made compiled version complete with instructions come see us in Discord, "OutlawsTheGame"!

## About
Have you ever wondered what additional stats you're missing out on while playing Outlaws? This mod brings you a little closer to a modern game statistics board. The game only displays your score (kills) but with this mod you'll be able to see KDR, kills, deaths and how many times you died a certain way. For the TNT enthusiasts I have also included the ability to track how high you fly. Save your stats to a photo for upload / bragging rights (Make sure you hit the 'HOME' key prior to the game exiting to the credits screen to save your score).

## Requirements
-The game must be a GOG / CD or my backspace patched version. Steam's executable is a different size executable and therefore will not work with this.
-"olcfg" must be set to 3Dfx Glide or Direct3D and the emulator MUST be NGLIDE. (Compatible emulators must use direct3d9 for this to work)
